# For this project, I used a database from SQLiteStudio.


#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';



#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';



#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";



#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';



#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;



#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepid = emp.Employeeid 
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.Customerid;



#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;



#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT count(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';



#9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT sum(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';



#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;



#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;



#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types m ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g ON g.GenreId= t.GenreId;



#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT 
    e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName as SalesAgent,
    SUM(i.Total) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId, SalesAgent
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;



#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT 
    e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS SalesAgent,
    SUM(i.Total) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND strftime('%Y', i.InvoiceDate) = '2009'
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId, SalesAgent
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 1;
